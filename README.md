# FinancialTimeSeriesPrediction

Code for the prediction of stock development based on a RNN and LSTM model. The data is downloaded from Alpha Vantage via a free key. The price development shows the closing price (here currently the IBM share is used) over the whole lifetime of the share since its IPO. 

Purpose of this code is to train how to work with machine learning models and obviously not to give a accurate prediction of the future stock prices.
